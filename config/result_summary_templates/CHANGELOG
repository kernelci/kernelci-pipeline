	Add support for a "metadata" section in the preset definitions. Each
	preset now contains a "metadata" section and a "preset" section,
	which contains the query parameters.

	All current examples now use the same set of generic templates.

	Preset-specific customizations, such as the report title, are now
	defined in the "metadata" sections.

	Preset-template association is no longer done via soft-links. Each
	preset defines the template it uses in its "metadata.template"
	field.

	Each preset may now define its default output file name in the
	"metadata.output" field. This can be overriden with the --output
	command line option.

	Documentation updated and this CHANGELOG file added.
